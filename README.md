# lua-utf8-identifiers

This is a version of Lua that allows UTF-8 identifiers. Not all Unicode code points are allowed; the set of allowed codepoints more or less follows the rules given in [Unicode® Standard Annex #31: Unicode Identifier and Pattern Syntax &sect; Default Identifiers](https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr31/#Default_Identifier_Syntax).

A custom header that determines which characters are allowed in identifiers is generated by a Lua script from [UnicodeData.txt](https://www.unicode.org/Public/UNIDATA/UnicodeData.txt). The current version is based on Unicode 11.0.
